## Week 3: Feature Focus (Day 21)

**Subject:** Intently Tip: Getting the most out of interventions

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

3 weeks in! You're a Intently veteran now. 🏆

Today I want to share a tip about the feature that makes Intently unique: **intervention screens**.

**Did You Know?**
Those reminder screens when you open Facebook/Instagram aren't just random messages. They're:

- 📚 Research-backed (based on behavioral science)
- 🔀 Rotating through 50+ different messages
- 🕐 Context-aware (different messages at night vs. morning)
- 🎯 Designed to make you think, not just annoy you

**The Science:**
Apps like "One Sec" found that intervention screens led to:
- 36% of users choosing NOT to open the app
- 37% reduction in session duration over 6 weeks
- Increased self-control without feeling restricted

**Your Experience:**
Have the intervention screens helped you?
- Do you actually read them?
- Have they changed your behavior?
- Do they feel helpful or annoying?

**Reply and let me know** - your feedback helps us calibrate the balance between effective friction and unnecessary annoyance.

**Quick Win:**
Next time you see an intervention screen, try this:
1. Actually read it (don't auto-tap)
2. Take one deep breath
3. Ask yourself: "Is this really what I want to do right now?"

You might surprise yourself.

**Coming Up:**
Next week we'll be inviting select beta testers for 30-minute interviews. If you're interested in sharing deeper feedback (and getting early access to premium features), hit reply!

Thanks for being part of this! 💙

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Still using Intently daily? You're in the top [X%] of beta testers! 🌟
