## Decision Points (Checkpoints)

### Checkpoint 1: After Phase 1
**Question:** Do users love the app?
- If YES → Proceed to Phase 2
- If NO → Iterate on UX until they do

### Checkpoint 2: After Phase 2
**Question:** Do users actually reduce usage?
- If YES → Proceed to Phase 3
- If NO → Re-evaluate core value proposition

### Checkpoint 3: After Phase 3
**Question:** Do users stick around?
- If YES → Proceed to Phase 4 (monetization)
- If NO → Add retention features until they do

### Checkpoint 4: After Phase 4
**Question:** Would users pay for premium features?
- If YES (30%+) → Launch paid tier in Phase 5
- If NO → Reassess what's valuable, don't force it

### Checkpoint 5: After Phase 5 (1 month)
**Question:** Is the business model sustainable?
- If YES → Scale in Phase 6
- If NO → Pivot pricing or features
