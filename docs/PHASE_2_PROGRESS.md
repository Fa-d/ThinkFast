### 2.3 User Interviews

  - "What would you pay for this?"
  - "What features do you NEED vs WANT?"
  - "What's missing that would make this essential?"
- [ ] Record insights and quotes
- [ ] Identify patterns across interviews

### 2.4 Data Collection & Analysis
- [ ] Update USER_RESEARCH.md with all findings

## Checkpoint: Before Phase 3

### Required Metrics
- [ ] 70%+ users reduced usage by 20%+ (validated data)
- [ ] NPS >40

- [ ] Would users pay? For what? How much?

### If Checkpoint Fails
- Revisit Phase 1 UX improvements
- Identify why users aren't getting value
