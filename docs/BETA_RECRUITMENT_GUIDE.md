**Title:** [Beta Testers Needed] Android app to reduce mindless social media scrolling

**Body:**
```
Hi r/[subreddit]!

I've been building an Android app called **ThinkFast** to help people reduce mindless social media usage, and I'm looking for 10-15 beta testers.

**What ThinkFast Does:**
- Shows intervention screens when you open Facebook/Instagram
- Tracks your daily usage and streak
- Helps you set realistic goals
- Uses research-backed behavioral science (not just blocking)

**The Problem I'm Solving:**
I kept opening Instagram without thinking. Even blocking apps didn't work because I'd just unblock them. I needed something that made me *pause and think* before scrolling.

**What I Need From You:**
- Use the app for 2-3 weeks
- Fill out 2 short surveys (5 mins each)
- Be honest about what works and what doesn't

**What You Get:**
- Early access before public launch
- Lifetime free access to premium features
- Direct influence on the roadmap
- Satisfaction of helping build something meaningful

**Requirements:**
- Android phone (6.0+)
- Use Facebook/Instagram regularly
- Willing to install APK or use TestFlight
- Comfortable giving constructive feedback

**Interested?**
Comment below or DM me and I'll send you the download link!

**Not Interested?**
No worries - thanks for reading! If you know someone who might benefit, feel free to share.

---

**Transparency:** I'm the solo developer building this. Not a big company, just someone trying to solve a problem I have. All feedback will be read and used to improve the app.
```

**Engagement Tips:**
- Respond to every comment within 2 hours
- Answer questions honestly
- Don't overpromise features
- Share your personal story
- Post during peak hours (9am-12pm or 6pm-9pm local time)

---

### Phase 3: Online Communities (Target: 5-10 testers)

**Facebook Groups:**
- Digital Minimalism groups
- Productivity groups
- Android enthusiast groups

**Discord Servers:**
- Productivity/self-improvement servers
- Android development communities

**Twitter:**
- Tweet about it with hashtags: #digitalwellbeing #screentime #productivity
- Ask followers directly

**Twitter Post Template:**

## Tracking Beta Testers

**Spreadsheet Template:**

| Name | Email | Source | Device | Install Date | Active | Week 1 Survey | Interview | Status |
|------|-------|--------|--------|--------------|--------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| Sarah M. | sarah@... | Reddit | Android 12 | 2024-12-28 | ✅ | ✅ Completed | ✅ Booked | Active |
| Mike J. | mike@... | Friend | iPhone 14 | 2024-12-28 | ❌ | - | - | Inactive |

**Statuses:**
- **Active:** Using app regularly, responding to surveys
- **Inactive:** Installed but not using
- **Churned:** Uninstalled or stopped responding
- **Super User:** Very engaged, great feedback

---

## Success Metrics

### Recruitment Goals (Phase 1):
- ✅ 10-30 beta testers recruited
- ✅ 70%+ install and complete onboarding
- ✅ 50%+ still active after 1 week
- ✅ 30%+ still active after 2 weeks

### Quality Indicators:
- Average survey response rate: 50%+
- Average survey completion time: <10 minutes
- Number of bug reports: Higher = more engaged
- Interview volunteers: 30%+

---

## Common Recruitment Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Accepting everyone:** Quality > Quantity. 10 engaged testers > 50 uninterested ones

❌ **No follow-up:** Send the welcome email within 24 hours of acceptance

❌ **Over-promising:** Don't promise features you can't deliver

❌ **Ignoring feedback:** If users report bugs, acknowledge and fix them

❌ **Being defensive:** When users criticize, say "Thanks for the feedback!" not "But actually..."

❌ **No incentive:** Give them a reason to stay engaged (early access, discount, acknowledgment)
